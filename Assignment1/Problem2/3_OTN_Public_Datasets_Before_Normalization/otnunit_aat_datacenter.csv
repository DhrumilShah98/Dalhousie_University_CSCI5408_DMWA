OTN-NEP,Ocean Tracking Network Northeast Pacific Node,"OTN is a research and technology development initiative headquartered at Dalhousie University, in Halifax Nova Scotia. Starting in 2008, OTN began deploying Canadian state of the art acoustic receivers and oceanographic monitoring equipment in key ocean locations. These are being used to document the movements and survival of marine animals carrying acoustic tags and to document how both are influenced by oceanographic conditions.
