Brown Trout were stocked in various New Brunswick lakes until the mid-1990â€™s by government personnel.  Brown Trout continue to persist in the Loch Lomond system and the Saint John River, specifically, the Meduxnekeg River, where Brown Trout are a common target recreational species.  There is little information on Brown Trout populations in New Brunswick and recent information suggests that other reproducing populations may be occurring in the lower Saint John River.  The extent of the Brown Trout dispersal is unknown.  Electrofishing surveys will be conducted in selected streams flowing into the lower Saint John River, Belleisle Bay, Kennebacasis Bay, Loch Lomond, and the Meduxnekeg River.    Fish collected will be identified, measured for length and weight, and released. Brown Trout from each site will receive a small fin clip for genetic analysis.  Brown Trout of an appropriate size will be surgically implanted with a Vemco V13 acoustic tag.

The mobility of the four most commercially important shark species have been studied using internally-implanted V-16 family transmitters and a network of cross-shelf acoustic receiver arrays spanning over 2,000 km of WA coastline. Additional detection data have been collected by partner organisations\' acoustic receivers in other parts of Australia. Bronze whaler (Carcharhinus brachyurus), dusky (Carcharhinus obscurus) and white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) have shown the greatest mobility, with cumulative individual movements of 11,180 km, 10,100 km and 6,990 km, respectively and have (so far) been monitored for periods of up to 1,735, 1,632 and 1,040 days, respectively. Individual tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier), sandbar (Carcharhinus plumbeus) and gummy sharks (Mustelus antarcticus) have also shown repeated long-distance movements between receiver arrays but these were observed less frequently and over smaller geographic ranges than other species. Although conventional tagging previously showed that whiskery sharks (Furgaleus macki) are capable of long-distance inter-jurisdictional movements, acoustic telemetry data suggest that this commercially-significant species\' movements are a less important issue for assessment and management than for other species. Acoustic tag detection data indicate that while potentially dangerous sharks may be present off the South and lower West coasts of WA throughout the year, white and bronze whaler sharks are more likely to be encountered during spring and early summer and are least likely to be present during late summer and autumn, while tiger sharks are most likely to be encountered through summer and autumn. This has important implications for the allocation of public safety resources and for individual\'s understanding of their exposure to shark encounter risks. The study has also enabled a re-evaluation of the risks of cryptic sources of dusky and sandbar shark catch and bycatch and the development of population simulation models to test future spatial-management arrangements for commercially-targeted whiskery and gummy shark stocks.','McAuley, R. 2011.

Yet, such individual-based movement data is vitally important to understand variability in migratory strategies and fidelity to foraging locations. A case in point is the economically important European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) that inhabits coastal waters during the summer months before migrating offshore to spawn and overwinter. Beyond this broad generalisation we have very limited information on the movements of individuals at coastal foraging grounds. We used acoustic telemetry to track the summer movements and seasonal migrations of individual sea bass in a large tidally and estuarine influenced coastal environment. We found that the vast majority of tagged sea bass displayed long-term residency (mean, 167 days) and inter-annual fidelity (93 percent return rate) to specific areas. We describe individual fish home ranges of 3km or less, and while fish clearly had core resident areas, there was movement of fish between closely located receivers. The combination of inter-annual fidelity to localised foraging areas makes sea bass very susceptible to local depletion; however, the designation of protected areas for sea bass may go a long way to ensuring the sustainability of this species.

In particular, we aim to understand sex- and size-specific differences in habitats used and broader-scale movements in and out of the estuary. Preliminary data suggest females may move towards tidal inlets or coastal waters, movements associated with egg release in other crustaceans. Green crabs are invasive along the North American seaboard, and have established large populations throughout the Gulf of Maine. Even with being ubiquitous in the region, little is known about green crab movements or habitat use, information that could be helpful in understanding or minimizing their spread (particularly those of large mature females). Thus, our project will directly contribute to OTNâ€™s mission to provide knowledge on movements and habitat use in order to inform sustainable management. The Webhannet estuary in the Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve (WNERR) is an ideal model system for quantifying green crab movements and habitat use. The estuary is small (~1.5 km-long by ~0.5 km-wide) and shallow, allowing a small telemetry array of < 10 receivers to cover the majority of the system, including all major tidal inlets and outlets. This system is also conducive to supplemental (and regular) manual tracking to locate tags throughout the system. In addition, geospatial data on habitats and bathymetry are available via the WNERR, along with a variety of environmental sensor data (e.g., YSI sondes and NOAA tide-gauge). Thus, we are hoping to directly link movements to variability in habitat (either physical or physiochemical).','Goldstein, J., Ryan, A., Furey, N. 2018.

This plan includes the development of an instream tidal turbine array in the Bay of Fundy. The Bay of Fundy has the highest tides in the world, making it a prime site for the operation of instream tidal turbines.  Extensive environmental monitoring must be performed before the installment of an array to better understand the effect turbines could have on marine species. In 2009, the Fundy Ocean Research Center for Energy was established in Minas Passage, Nova Scotia to test instream tidal turbines. It is unknown whether the installation of turbines in Minas Passage could negatively influence the abundance of fish stocks that inhabit Minas Basin. It is important to know how tidal turbines influence the behavior of all species, but especially those currently federally listed as endangered (e.g., Atlantic salmon), since losses at the individual level could negatively affect the population (i.e. iBOF Atlantic Salmon).  Approximately 70 species of fish migrate through Minas Passage to access Minas Basin for feeding. Species abundance estimates are known for a handful of these species, including Gaspereau River Alewife, Shubenacadie River Striped Bass and Saint John River Atlantic Sturgeon. Five species of fish (Atlantic salmon, Atlantic herring, Alewife, Striped bass, and Atlantic Sturgeon) will be tagged with new High Residency (HR) fish tagging technology developed by a local NS company (Vemco). This technology can detect fish in environments with high current speeds (i.e., Minas Passage 6 m/s).  The information obtained from the HR tags will be used to determine the effects tidal turbines have at the individual level for endangered species like the Atlantic salmon, and at the population level for species with known population estimates.','Stokesbury, M.J.W., Sanderson, B., Redden, A., Hardie, D., Gibson, J., Bradford, R., Dadswell, M. 2017.

One of the most economically valuable sportfish in the Indian River Lagoon is the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus). Previous local studies of red drum document strong site fidelity, with some mature individuals residing and spawning within the lagoon year-round (Reyier et al 2011).  This behavior is uncommon in other portions of their geographic range, suggesting future abundance and harvest of red drum is partially dependent on continued spawning success within the lagoon. The Integrate-Transfer-Launch (ITL) complex impoundments located within Kennedy Space Center security zone are proven spawning sites of red drum (Garreau et al 2014).  However, recent construction of manatee exclusion bollards around culverts leading into these impoundments on roads operated by Cape Canaveral Air Force Station may be impacting movement to and from these historic spawning sites. This project proposes to use acoustic telemetry to quantify patterns of red drum movement and habitat use within the Kennedy Space Center security zone, and to assess how manatee exclusion bollards in the ITL-impoundment area potentially impact movement of red drum.  These data will be used in conjunction with bollard size and spacing, pertinent morphometric data (e.g. length, head width, body width, weight), and habitat conditions to develop optimal management strategies that minimize potential adverse effects on manatees and maximize red drum access to spawning sites, thereby helping to ensure the sustainability of this iconic fishery.','Baker, SM., Reyier, EA., Cook, GS. 2017.

Optimizing the number of smolts that enter the ocean from coastal rivers and into the Gulf of Maine is a management priority.  Until recently, the Narraguagus River has been solely supported by natural reproduction and fry stocking within the watershed. In 2008, a five year smolt stocking effort was implemented with intentions of boosting adult returns.  Approximately 40,000 smolts were stocked annually over this five year period with limited success. 154 2SW adult returns were documented, which is 5.6 2SW adults per 10,000 smolts stocked. These results are much lower than the natural component (63.2/10,000) of the Narraguagus and returns from age 1 hatchery smolt stocking on other nearby systems during the same timeframe. Through this effort we will investigate and describe the behavior and success of conservation hatchery smolt with differing release times migrating through the river, estuary, and nearshore environment to determine if there are differences between groups.  In addition to migration performance, we will identify bottlenecks (predation, environment, habitat, etc) which will inform managers of areas of focus during restoration efforts within the watershed to optimize the number of post smolts entering the Gulf of Maine.','Hawkes, J.P., Goulette, G.S. 2017.

This project will evaluate homing success of these fish from a release site in the Inner Bay of Fundy. The smolts originate from efforts of conservation river-stocking of native strains of fry and fall parr in years past. After capture at the mouth of the USR, the smolts were transported to a commercial sea cage operated by the aquaculture industry in Back Bay NB for rearing. In addition to cage-reared smolt, a similar group of grilse reared in a Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) hatchery in Mactaquac NB will be released to determine effects of smolt-grilse rearing strategy on homing success. Fish are planned to be released well inside the Inner Bay of Fundy near Fundy National Park. All fish will be tagged with an externally visible tag for detection by ongoing dive surveys on the USR if they successfully home to the river they were captured from in 2010.  To corroborate diver observations, we will deploy acoustic receivers at the mouth of USR and adjacent rivers and implant acoustic tags in a subset of the released fish to estimate homing and stray rates. As with any tagging project of this nature, results and associated conclusions are improved with increasing numbers of tagged individuals.   Recovery programs for Inner Bay of Fundy Salmon have been unsuccessful in producing suitable numbers of returning individuals yet it is unclear whether captive reared fish are being lost to various threats during marine migration or simply do not have the natural instinct to return.  This project provides valuable knowledge for salmon recovery program managers by evaluating the ability of captive-reared salmon to return to rivers they migrated from as smolt.  Results will be of particular value to a projected increasing number of salmon recovery program managers as more populations become threatened with decline.

Cod, like many cultured marine fishes, are particularly prone to escape from sea cages by biting holes in nets. Following escape, farmed cod interact with wild cod. The depleted populations of wild cod in the northwest Atlantic may be especially vulnerable to negative interactions with escapees. We are asking the question: what do farmed cod do following escape? We used acoustic telemetry to investigate behaviour (dispersal) following a simulated escape from a sea cage. Wild (locally caught) cod dispersed from the cage more quickly than farmed cod, taking 5.5 hours for 50% of the wild cod to disperse > 1 km from the cage site, compared with 12.6 h for farmed cod. Farmed cod spent most of their time near the cage, while wild cod spent most of their time at the mouth of the bay at a traditional feeding ground. Following departure from the cage area, farmed and wild cod dispersed mostly northward along the coast, and within 4.5 months post release 55% of wild and 88% of farmed cod had been detected on an acoustic receiver array located 25 km northward of the cage site close to the coastline. The results suggest that escaped farmed cod could only be recaptured near the cage within a day of the escape event. Following the initial escape period, farmed cod showed a similar dispersal pattern to wild cod and could potentially interact with them. The results of our study can be applied to the emerging cod aquaculture industry, as well as that of other marine finfish, to reduce the number of escapes, streamlining the development of the industry before mitigation becomes too difficult and costly to implement.','Fleming, I.A., Zimmerman, E., Purchase, C.F., Brattey, J., Porter, D. 2011.

In 2015, a snow crab movement monitoring project was established in the St. Anns Bank area, with collaboration between industry, the OTN and DFO.  Acoustic receiver arrays deployed as part of this project  can provide an opportunity to record the presence of tagged species who reside in, or transit through, the MPA. In particular, acoustic monitoring of tagged focal species (Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic striped wolfish (Anarhichas lupus)) inside the MPA and beyond the receiver array, will provide important information for performance evaluation and design.','Stanley, R; Zisserson, B and Fenton, D. 2016.

The challenge is to determine the size of the fish and what actually happens after the fish are released. Traditionally very expensive archival and satellite tags have been used to monitor movement and estimate post release mortality. However, new high resolution multi-beam sonar is capable of visually tracking tuna detected with acoustic tags at distances of up to 1000m in real time while actively transmitting. This provides a mechanism of tracking the fish and monitoring its behaviour immediately upon it release. The sonar system is also capable of estimating the size of individual targets to within a few cm, while they are on the line or being run prior to release. Because the tags have a battery life 3 years or more and are detectable by the OTN arrays, movements of tagged fish may be passively monitored by the arrays and actively monitored by our team when they return to the same survey areas for several years. The objective of the project is to collaborate with the fishing industry (recreational and commercial) to estimate the size of bluefin tuna while still in the water and to estimate their post release mortality using the much less expensive acoustic tags and multi-beam sonar. Subsequent observations would be made if the fish returned to the fishing area. The technology will allow the monitoring of fish behaviour immediately after release. Recent studies using this sonar technology have clearly illustrated the detection of bluefin tuna and estimated their swimming speed and inter-spatial distance between fish when aggregated.','Melvin, G.D. 2017.

The area is part of  the Coral Coast MPA, the largest federal marine protected area in Brazil, with 135 ??. In 2013 the establishment of no-take zones was incorporated in the management plan and replicated along the coast within its boundaries. The expected benefits are not only recovery of marine life inside the area but also benefits to the outside areas through spillover of adults and propagules. Although higher number and biomass of species has been observed inside its boundaries, the benefit for adjacent areas through spill over of individuals needs to be verified.  To fulfil this need, a study of fish movement was designed and implemented in 2014. The aim is to evaluate reef fish habitat use and movement patterns, spill over effect and thus to determine no-take zone effectiveness. The TamandarÃ© array initially consisted of 10 VR2W receivers in the no take area and was expanded to an 18 receivers array in December 2016, covering both the no take area and its surroundings (through a collaboration with Texas A&M University). Areas with distinct reef morphologies (shallow and deep patch reefs, deep submerged reefs, back reef and front reef areas) and physical conditions (wave action, current and tidal effects) are being monitored and the array covers depths from about 1m to 15m.

Since, there has been a marked decline in the native freshwater fish fauna, which consists of only three species of galaxiid fishes, endemic to the Southern Hemisphere (zebra trout Aplochiton zebra, Aplochiton taeniatus, and the Falklands minnow Galaxias maculatus; Vanhaecke et al. 2012). Given the threats to the long-term conservation of the native galaxiids, detailed knowledge about the life history, movement ecology of brown trout and their overlap and interactions with the native species is urgently needed. However, at present virtually nothing is known about the extent and seasonality of brown trout movements in the Falkland Islands, or how these can impact on native galaxiids. Two presence/absence surveys, conducted 10 and 20 years ago respectively, provided valuable synoptic snapshots of the distribution of brown trout and galaxiids in the Falklands. McDowall et al. (2001) used electrofishing to survey the islands in 1999 and showed that brown trout had invaded most rivers with the exception of those in the southwest region of West Falkland (Lafonia). Elsewhere, brown trout showed a high degree of spatial segregation with zebra trout in particular, which may indicate competitive displacement and/or predation of zebra trout by brown trout, and may thus explain the decline of Aplochiton sp. since the 1950s. At the time of the survey, most zebra trout were concentrated within small refuge areas uninvaded by brown trout. However, the tendency of brown trout to display anadromy in the Falklands, makes it likely that they could eventually colonize all the accessible rivers. The risk of native galaxiid extinction is therefore high. With this in mind, our study aims to answer two main questions about the movement ecology of brown trout in the Falklands: (1) what is the current distribution, abundance and population structure of brown trout? and (2) what are the impacts of brown trout on native galaxiids? These questions will be answered by employing a variety of techniques including environmental DNA to non-destructively assess the distribution and abundance of brown trout and native galaxiids in various watershed, in conjunction with electrofishing, which will allow us to estimate population (or river stock) abundance as well as assess the health and reproductive status of individuals and stocks. Electrofishing will also provide us with an opportunity to capture individual brown trout for acoustic tagging from different watersheds, thus allowing us to meet our first aim by tracking individual movements and dispersal patterns, among watersheds and between East and West Falklands. We will also take fin samples from individuals for genotyping, thus obtaining data on the genetic diversity and gene flow between watersheds of brown trout and native species. Stable isotope analysis will also be conducted on fin samples from brown trout and native galaxiids to determine the levels of trophic overlap and predation between species.','Minett, J., Garcia de Leaniz, C., Consuegra, S., Crossin, G., Brickle, P. 2018.Brown trout in the Falkland Islands: invasion ecology, population structure and genetic diversity.','Jessica Minett','Swansea U','787346@swansea.ac.uk','http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/V2LFALK.htm','; EARTH SCIENCE > BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION > ANIMALS/VERTEBRATES > FISH','GCMD','By accessing or using OTN Data you agree to: a) give proper attribution to all Data Providers and to OTN by using the preformed citations contained in OTN metadata reports and in the data records, b) inform OTN of publications, products or commercial applications using the data, c) acknowledge that neither the OTN nor the provider is liable for inaccuracies in the data, d) assume responsibility for investigating and understanding the limitations of the data, e) report all problems with respect to data to otndc@dal.ca.

However, here too they are under significant threat from incidental catch in poorly-managed commercial and recreational fisheries, habitat degradation from pollution, coastal development and marine infrastructure and disturbance by divers and beach users. Over the last three years, the Angel Shark Project has become the established authority for angel shark conservation and research in Europe. This has been established through gathering critical information on angel shark distribution via our network of partners including sport fishers, dive operators and local NGOs. The proposed project therefore builds on this distribution data to address key questions about residency and space use of S. squatina. The lack of knowledge around the timing and distances of movements in this species is hampering current efforts to establish and implement protection throughout the area. As such, the data from a deployment of year-round acoustic receivers will directly inform the Spanish Governmentâ€™s proposed management strategies for The Canaries. In addition to movement data, this collaborative project funded by the National Geographic and Lisbon aquarium, is developing a bespoke tagging and attachment methodology to enable the external tagging of angel sharks in situ as they rest on the substrate, avoiding capture and stress of individuals. This open source methodology will likely facilitate the attachment of tags to other benthic species where capture of individuals is problematic or politically sensitive. To our knowledge, this will be the first deployment of long-term tracking equipment for S. squatina providing essential data that will act as a baseline for future actions attempting to conserve this species.','Barker, J., Alvarado, D., Meyers, E., Jacoby, D. 2018.

All sea life and commerce passes through this 14-km wide passage and the high evaporation rate causes dense highly saline water to form and sink inside. This leads to surface inflow from the North Atlantic and bottom outflow of western Mediterranean deep water that flows into the Atlantic and affects the deep ocean thermohaline circulation called the global â€œair conditioner.â€ This system is vulnerable to climate change and may have positive feedback effects. The currents can be very variable under the influence of winds and tides and regulate the movements of both commercial and conservation species. The Gibraltar Line is ideally suited to monitor and understand all of these phenomena. It is deep enough to avoid interference from commercial traffic and operates as a continuous ocean observation system to detect rare events, both oceanographic and biological. It complements satellite observations of surface waters. There are plans to monitor species including iconic whales, turtles, and tuna, as well as commercial bream, cuttlefish, octopus, squid, and eels. The Line itself has been carefully surveyed and will require 26 km of equipment to avoid excessive depths and currents as well as trawlable bottom. The highest profile species is the bluefin tuna, which can sell for over $100,000 each and were recently proposed and denied CITES status after years of overfishing.

We have three years of data (2014-2016) conducted in late August through October, which is when sediment deposition is allowed. The first two years we used a similar design. There were 2 arrays (control and impact, separated by ~1.8 km) of 4 receivers each arranged in a square formation. Receiver moorings in an array were ~300 meters apart. Each mooring had a V2RW or VR2Tx receiver located 7 m above the bottom and a synch tag 8 m above the bottom (for V2RW units). A subsurface float kept the mooring line near-vertical. We used this arrangement with the Vemco VPS to compare trajectories of crabs at impact and control treatments. In 2015 we also had 2 receivers along the South Jetty for a portion of the study (SJ.1 and SJ.2) to act as a â€œgatewayâ€. In 2016 we expanded and re-arranged the receivers into 13 receivers in a 3 x 5 node rectangle formation (minus 2 interior nodes). The array was divided into impact (north) and control (south) sub-arrays. We also deployed 2 moorings as a gateway near the South Jetty, as in 2015. Synch tag signals from these moorings (which were in contact with each other) may be detected by some of the moorings in the main array. A third mooring was positioned several kilometers away as a lone sentinel. It recorded presence of some our tagged crabs but was outside the range of the other receivers. Two additional nodes were deployed inside the Columbia River Estuary (ETI and TS), also out of range of other receivers. During an experiment, we released batches of 10 crabs in the center of each subarray. In the impact array, a large hopper dredge deposited a plume of sediment on the crabs\\; the control array received no sediment. We repeated the experiment three time in 2014 and 2015 and twice in 2016. In 2016, we also released 20 tagged crabs in the estuary. There were reference tags deployed in each array as well.

Sentinel acoustic receivers situated near the release site and in the lower Fraser River, and acoustic curtains associated with POST were used to determine travel rates and locales and levels of mortality.

But they travelled ~ 5 km/h through the expansive fast flowing sections in between. Diel patterns were evident. On average fish reached the ocean in ~ 8 days with a range of 5-17 days among fish.

Coastal impacts are particularly high on top and mesopredators, which have suffered disproportionate extinctions and local depletions worldwide. Appropriate ecosystem-based management and large-scale restoration necessitates a better understanding of the effects of anthropogenic drivers on the spatial ecology (movement, habitat use and distributional patterns) of coastal top and mesopredators. The coastal Everglades are an iconic freshwater and estuarine ecosystem, strongly impacted by changes in freshwater delivery (due to upstream drainage and impoundment), and highly vulnerable to sea level rise (2/3 of Everglades National Park is below 3 ft above sea level). Despite this high socioecological value of the coastal Everglades, the effects of over 100 years of altered hydrology on the ecology of these predatory species remains poorly understood. More importantly, our understanding of how these species will respond to the balance of restoration actions (designed to increase freshwater deliveries) and sea level rise is very limited. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to establish CELA2 (Coastal Everglades Lakes Acoustic Array). The purpose of the array is to examine the spatial ecology of coastal predators in relation to key hydroclimatic and habitat drivers. In particular, our research asks the following questions: (1) How does the movement, habitat use and distribution of top and mesopredators in coastal Everglades habitats vary across space (lakes, creeks and coastal embayments of Florida Bay) and time (wet vs. dry season and years of varying freshwater inflows)? (2) What is the relative role of hydrological (e.g., freshwater flows, salinity), climatic (e.g., temperature, wind, storms), and habitat characteristics (e.g., nutrients, oxygen, vegetation cover) in driving predator patterns of movement, habitat use and distribution? (3) In particular, how is predator movement, habitat use and distribution influenced by state changes related to eutrophication?  (4) And, to what extent are spatial patterns and responses to environmental drivers species-specific? CELA2 encompasses the Alligator Creek and McCormick Creek  subestuaries in northcentral Florida Bay, Everglades National Park. Both systems contain a series of lakes connected by creeks and with outlets to Florida Bay. Both systems are characterized by a north to south gradient in salinity, with overall higher salinity conditions relative to the pre-drainage Everglades. With lower freshwater inflows, the region has undergone nutrient enrichment resulting from a greater influence of nutrient-rich marine, and in particular the Allligator Creek system has undergone a state change, from an SAV dominated systems to an enriched phytoplankton state. We hypothesize that this shift in benthic to planktonic primary production will influence habitat quality for predators via its effects on abiotic regimes (e.g., oxygen, visibility), and on secondary production (e.g., prey quantity, quality and availability).

In theory, individuals should migrate to sea if such behavior increases reproductive success. It has been shown, that migratory differences not only rely to resident or migratory individuals. Within a seaward migrating group of trout, large differences in distance migrated away from the river can often be found. Some stay close, while other migrates far away. In this project, we will aim to map physiologically differences between juvenile trout that become residents or migrate to sea and between short and long distance migratory sea trout. Seaward migration is a behavior that can be expected when the gain for the individual fish is higher than the cost. Consequently, one can expect that this behavior will be changed or disappear if sea conditions are so negative for sea trout that it loses reproductive potential by migrating to sea.','Davidsen, J.G. et al 2016.

The assemblage include a wide spectrum of species from large and small coastal species to pelagic species and from highly migratory to resident species, as well as species endemic to Cabo Verde, such as the Cabo Verde skate, Raja herwigi, and semi-endemic species (endemic to West Africa), such as the Atlantic weasel shark, Paragaleus pectoralis. Neonates and adult individuals are present and this wide demographic spread indicates that essential and important, but largely uncharacterized, habitats of elasmobranch are present in this region and it is believed to be one of the last refugees for elasmobranchs in West Africa, and indeed the North Atlantic Ocean. However, detailed scientific information is scarce preventing any science-based management efforts. The high value of this area in conjunction with the ability to study and protect some species within Marine Protected Areas means the region can offer some degree of sanctuary from the world-wide decline in elasmobranch species. This decline is mainly triggered by the high demand for shark fins and flesh and primarily the result of unstainable fishing practices and lacking or inadequate management. There is growing public and scientific concern over the global decline of elasmobranch populations and the consequences of such declines include changes in the structure, function and stability of marine ecosystems. Currently, there is no stock assessment available for any elasmobranch species in Cabo Verde and although marine reserves have been established, their benefit for elasmobranch conservation remains unclear. Hence, more detailed scientific information is needed to allow for a comprehensive and successful elasmobranch conservation strategy in Cabo Verde. Moreover, the characterization and conservation of Cabo Verde elasmobranch populations will contribute to both, the preservation of species diversity and support a sustainable resource for ecotourism and fisheries. Therefore, the Cabo Verde Elasmobranch Research Project aims to improve our understanding of the biology, ecology, and conservation status of elasmobranchs in Cabo Verde waters in order to provide a scientific basis for comprehensive protection and management, aid the science of these species and to benefit local communities and Cabo Verde in terms of fisheries, education and maintenance of biodiversity. The Project is based on an interdisciplinary approach with the goal of bringing together international and Cabo Verdean researchers, government representatives and resource managers, industry, NGOs and local communities, translating scientific information into on-the-water conservation measures and ensuring the effectiveness of management efforts. Canadian, Cabo Verdean and international researchers will collaborate to support long-term sustainability of elasmobranch populations through species assessments, field surveys, collection of fisheries data, telemetry studies, stock assessments, the collection of biological or environmental data, and gathering local ecological knowledge observations. The local knowledge of Cabo Verdeans who use the sea, such as traditional fishermen, will be an invaluable assistance in achieving these goals.','Dureuil, M., Worm, B., Townsend, B., Whoriskey, F., Harvey-Clark, C., Monteiro, C., Martins, A., Silva, P., Evora, D., Melo, T., Rendall Rocha, P., Portugues, S., Stiebens, V. 2015','Fred Whoriskey','OTN','fwhoriskey@dal.ca','http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/V2LCV.htm','ACOUSTIC RECEIVERS; DETECTIONS; ACOUSTIC TRANSMITTERS; ; EARTH SCIENCE > BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION > ANIMALS/VERTEBRATES > FISH','GCMD','By accessing or using OTN Data you agree to: a) give proper attribution to all Data Providers and to OTN by using the preformed citations contained in OTN metadata reports and in the data records, b) inform OTN of publications, products or commercial applications using the data, c) acknowledge that neither the OTN nor the provider is liable for inaccuracies in the data, d) assume responsibility for investigating and understanding the limitations of the data, e) report all problems with respect to data to otndc@dal.ca.

One of the most economically valuable sportfish in the Indian River Lagoon is the red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus). Previous local studies of red drum document strong site fidelity, with some mature individuals residing and spawning within the lagoon year-round (Reyier et al 2011).  This behavior is uncommon in other portions of their geographic range, suggesting future abundance and harvest of red drum is partially dependent on continued spawning success within the lagoon. The Integrate-Transfer-Launch (ITL) complex impoundments located within Kennedy Space Center security zone are proven spawning sites of red drum (Garreau et al 2014).  However, recent construction of manatee exclusion bollards around culverts leading into these impoundments on roads operated by Cape Canaveral Air Force Station may be impacting movement to and from these historic spawning sites. This project proposes to use acoustic telemetry to quantify patterns of red drum movement and habitat use within the Kennedy Space Center security zone, and to assess how manatee exclusion bollards in the ITL-impoundment area potentially impact movement of red drum.  These data will be used in conjunction with bollard size and spacing, pertinent morphometric data (e.g. length, head width, body width, weight), and habitat conditions to develop optimal management strategies that minimize potential adverse effects on manatees and maximize red drum access to spawning sites, thereby helping to ensure the sustainability of this iconic fishery.','Baker, SM., Reyier, EA., Cook, GS. 2017.

Receivers were deployed such that a single microhabitat type was spatially dominant within detection range.  Microhabitats chosen for comparison were deep (> 2 m) channels, shallow (< 2 m) sand flats, oyster reefs, and seagrass beds, and receivers were deployed at sites both relatively nearer and farther from Beaufort Inlet, the closest access to the Atlantic Ocean.  Receivers at seagrass and sand flat sites were deployed between May 28 and June 5, 2015, and receivers loaned by the Ocean Tracking Network were deployed at oyster reef and deep channel sites on September 30, 2015.  All receivers were recovered on November 11-12, 2015.  Blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), blacknose (Carcharhinus acronotus), bull (Carcharhinus leucas), and bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo) sharks were targeted for acoustic tagging.  Sharks were captured using gillnet, longline, and drumline gear deployed as part of a fishery-independent survey conducted in Back and Core Sounds from April through October 2015.  Individuals of the four target species and in good condition at capture were tagged by surgically implanting a Vemco V16 69 kHz transmitter into the body cavity.  Habitat preference was analyzed using the number of detections and number of visits, defined as a periods of continuous detection, at a particular receiver site.  One blacktip shark and three blacknose sharks were acoustically tagged, of which two blacknose sharks were detected on the array.  One appeared to suffer post-release mortality and was continuously detected on both the oyster reef far from inlet and seagrass bed near inlet receivers from two days after tagging until receivers were recovered, suggesting it or the tag had settled on the bottom between those receivers.  The other blacknose shark was detected briefly at the sand flat near inlet site approximately an hour after tagging.  In addition, a cownose ray (Rhinoptera bonasus), finetooth shark (Carcharhinus isodon), and bull shark tagged by other members of the Atlantic Cooperative Telemetry Network were detected on the array.  Of all tagged elasmobranchs, the bull shark, tagged by Debra Abercrombie from Stony Brook University, had both the highest number of detections and visits to array sites and appeared to show a preference for sand flat and oyster reef habitats, particularly at night.

It achieves this through the use of shark nets and drumlines which catch and kill sharks in the vicinity of netted beaches. Shark nets are currently installed at 38 beaches over 320 km of coastline along the KZN coastline. Most of the shark nets deployed by the KZNSB are 214 m long and 6 m deep. The nets do not act as a physical barrier, but rather act as a gill net, which entangles the sharks. Drumlines were introduced in the last five years at some netted beaches. They consist of a large, anchored float (originally a drum) from which a single baited hook is suspended. The KZNSB is also mandated to minimize any negative impacts on the marine environment by reducing the bycatch of non-target species e.g. harmless sharks and cetaceans. In order to achieve these mandates it is critical to gain a better understanding of the movement and residency patterns of potentially dangerous sharks (bull, white and tiger) along its netted area of operation between Richards bay and Port Edward on the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coastline. This information is crucial not only in minimizing the risk of shark attack at both netted and non-netted beaches, but also in enabling the KZNSB to make informed decisions on the deployment and location of shark nets to reduce the catch of harmless animals. To achieve this goal we intend to deploy an array of 26 VR2w receivers at strategic locations along the KZN coastline and attach acoustic transmitters to 40 bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas), which is the species historically responsible for most attacks in KZN.

This species is known to exhibit complex seasonal migrations between winter spawning and summer feeding grounds. However, there is recent evidence to suggest that Pacific cod that reside in fjords and enclosed bays may be comprised of more resident, genetically isolated populations. The primary Pacific cod fishery coincides with the winter spawning season. Without proper management, isolated spawning stocks could be easily depleted. Prince William Sound is a fjord-dominated ecosystem in the Gulf of Alaska that may support a resident, non-migratory Pacific cod population. Currently the Prince William Sound population is managed as part of the Gulf of Alaska stock, however, the movements and ecology of these fjord-residing fish remains unknown. Understanding population dynamics and connectivity between fisheries management areas is essential to maintaining sustainable harvest levels of Pacific cod. Here we propose to utilize acoustic telemetry to investigate connectivity between Pacific cod stocks in the Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska. Specific project objectives include: (1) document movements of individual acoustically tagged cod between Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska, (2) investigate residency of tagged cod to the Sound as well as tagging bays and (3) examine spawning site fidelity to specific Prince William Sound bays. The results of this study will have important fisheries management implications for similar bay and fjord-dominated ecosystems found throughout the extensive range of the Pacific cod.','Bishop, M.A., McKinzie, M. 2013.

The second is to assess how temperature experience and physiological state influences survival to the natal river and to spawning grounds.  In summer 2010, ~ 1,000 adult Fraser River sockeye salmon were captured in coastal areas during their homeward migration and implanted gastrically with either radio transmitters (600) or acoustic transmitters (400). All transmitters carried thermal data loggers and half of all fish were tissue biopsied and plasma sampled prior to release. Included in the study was an examination of how different handling techniques influenced the fate of fish, serving to both inform researcher handling as well as providing some preliminary data for future projects that will be focused on Pacific salmon catch-and-release issues in the recreational and commercial fisheries. CTD surveys were conducted to characterize oceanographic conditions where fish were migrating. Acoustic receiver curtains in the ocean associated with the Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) project, and sentinel acoustic and radio receivers situated throughout the Fraser River watershed were used to assess speeds and fate of fish. Field work was just completed (Sept 2010). Downloading of receivers will be completed by late fall.','Drenner, M., Clark T., Burt, J., Lotto, A., Hinch, S., Farrell, T., Cooke, S., Miller, K., Thomson, R., Patterson, D. 2010.

Maintenance of shipping channels involves dredge operations to maintain sufficient in-channel depths to allow large ships to navigate the waterways safely. Fishes entrained by dredge equipment often die or experience delayed mortality. Other potential negative effects of dredging include increased turbidity, reductions in prey resources, and the release of harmful contaminants from the dredged sediments. One species of concern is the ESA-listed green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris; Southern Distinct Population Segment). In this study, we used acoustic telemetry to identify habitat use, arrival and departure timing, and the extent of upstream migration of green sturgeon in the Columbia River and Coos Bay to help inform dredge operations to minimize potential take of green sturgeon. Autonomous acoustic receivers were deployed in Coos Bay from the mouth to river kilometer (rkm) 21.6 from October 2009 through October 2010. In the Columbia River Estuary, receivers were deployed between the mouth and rkm 37.8 from April to November in 2010 and 2011. A total of 29 subadult and adult green sturgeon were tagged with temperature and pressure sensor tags and released during the study, primarily in Willapa Bay and Grays Harbor, Washington, and the Klamath River, Oregon.

In particular, this research is beneficial for comparison of adult green sturgeon spawning and holding behaviors and habitat needs and/or restrictions in the Sacramento and Feather rivers especially in regards to recovery of the species. Information that currently exists about the southern DPS (sDPS) indicates that the mainstem Sacramento River is the only known spawning area for the species. However, green sturgeon spawning was documented for the first time in the lower Feather River in 2011. Therefore, determining how often green sturgeon utilize the lower Feather River for spawning is important for evaluating whether the sDPS may have (or the potential for) a viable second spawning area. It is also important to understand if the system is being utilized as a holding or feeding area for fish that will later migrate and spawn in the Sacramento River. Understanding what benefits or detriments the lower Feather River provides to the sDPS of green sturgeon will provide valuable information for future management and enhancement of the system for the species. The objectives of this study are: 1) determine if there are adult migration barriers and if so evaluate them; 2) evaluate migration patterns including residence times and factors affecting them; 3) identify distribution and habitat preferences; 4) evaluate the effect of Oroville Facilities operations on passage success and distribution; 5) estimate the annual abundance of adult green sturgeon; 6) determine potential spawning grounds which can be target areas for egg and larval surveys; and 7) provide data to make management decisions concerning future monitoring programs, operational changes of the facilities, and/or habitat enhancement within the lower Feather River.','Manuel, M., Rocheleau, D., McAllister, K., Seesholtz, A. 2008.

It provides coverage across part of the inner Moray Firth to detect tagged Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts and sea trout (Salmo trutta) smolts as they migrate from the Cromarty Firth. The VR2ARs are on loan from the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN). The Array has been installed to give more information on the migration routes of the smolts tagged in the Conon River system. 150 salmon and 20 sea trout smolts were tagged in late April with 7 mm coded acoustic tags by the Scottish Centre for Ecology and the Natural Environment (SCENE). SCENE have been Commissioned by Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited BOWL to carry out this work to discharge Section 36 consent and Marine Licence conditions. The salmon smolts were collected from the River Bran (a tributary of the Conon) at Achanalt. Fish were tagged and then immediately released downstream of the Torr Achilty power station on the lower River Conon to continue their migration.  Two types of tags were used, Thelma Biotel (ADT-LP-7,3) in salmon smolts and Vemco (V7) in sea trout smolts. MSS have designed and commissioned pop-up rope canisters to house the VR2ARs to allow the recovery of the weights and avoid acoustic shadows caused by flotation buoys above the hydrophone. These rope canisters were designed to Accommodate up to 150 m of 4 mm Dyneema rope. This allows the safe recovery of the 70 kg clump anchor weights in up to 100 m of water. The installation of the VR2ARs was carried out on the Coral Wind on the 19th April 2016 and all 40 moorings were deployed in one day. MSS have scheduled the receiver recovery for the start of August. We plan to provide initial assessments of patterns in the migration vectors of the fish leaving the Cromarty Firth by late autumn.','Gardiner, R., Stainer, P., Edwards, E., Watret, R., Thorburn, J., Newton, M., Main, R. 2016.

However, it is the hammerhead sharks, particularly the scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini, which are showing among the most drastic declines of all large-bodied sharks worldwide, between 80-90% in many parts of the world (Myers et al 2007, Ferretti et al 2008, Ferretti et al 2010). While there currently are very few data on population trends in other parts of their range (i.e., Asian Pacific), these areas have limited recording of catch data and poor management of fisheries, and there are concerns that declines for this species may be equal or greater in these areas. The scalloped hammerhead, Sphyrna lewini, is the only extant, large-bodied shark species that displays highly organized and complex social behavior (e.g., Klimley and Nelson 1981). Large, sexually-segregated groups are known to school in a few, predictable locations, including Cocos Island, the Galapagos, and the Gulf of California. These stocks are highly vulnerable in these phases, and as such the above locations have all benefited from some form of local protective measures. For example, hammerhead sharks in the Galapagos and Cocos Island are both protected under marine reserves, the former of which being a world heritage site. Since this species is highly vulnerable when they aggregate, these aggregations are well-suited for protective measures. However, marine spatial planning and reserve design and implementation are impossible without a deep understanding of the dynamics of the aggregation. We initiated an expedition and study to advance our understanding of a new aggregation of scalloped hammerhead sharks off coastal Japan. Our overarching objective is to gather spatial, temporal, and behavioral data on an isolated and unprotected aggregation of scalloped hammerhead sharks found off Japan. There are several project goals: To gather baseline data on the daily, monthly, and yearly presence of sharks at the island and determine size and sex-based differences. To characterize the home range and space utilization of sharks at the island and to correlate visitation frequency patterns with the abundance of prey species and localised oceanography. To explore the social networks of large social apex predatory sharks by quantifying and comparing empirical linkages in habitat use. To determine the site fidelity and social networks of sharks to better understand the seasonal risks they face when they are absent and present from the island. To establish a long-term research and monitoring project with the local dive center and communities that will generate consistent data reporting, local stewardship in research and conservation.','Jacoby, D., Papastamatiou, Y., Watanabe, Y., Gallagher, A. 2015.

Indeed, there is concern  that juvenile rainbow trout may out-compete Atlantic salmon for riffle  habitat, contributing to their decline on the Island. One plausible  explanation for the success of rainbow trout is their resilience to  environmental perturbation (e.g. sedimentation or pesticide runoff).  To better understand the lifecycle of rainbow trout, adult trout were  tagged and tracked using sonic telemetry in collaboration with the  Ocean Tracking Network. We investigated the hypothesis that PEI may be  a source of vagrant rainbow trout migrating throughout the Gulf of St  Lawrence. Trout were tagged in rivers draining into the Monatgue  estuary. Trout in this study did not migrate long distances, in fact  none of the tagged fish left the receiver arrays in the estuary.  During the study period nutrient loading and water chemistry were  monitored throughout the watershed. Like many estuaries across PEI,  mid-summer macroalgal blooms resulted in depleted oxygen levels.  Tagged fish exhibited an extreme tolerance for both the high  temperature and the hypoxic and anoxic conditions, showing no  avoidance of such conditions. Thus, this investigation adds support to  the body of information suggesting the rainbow trout have been  successful because of their tolerance of degraded ecosystem integrity.','Roloson, S.D., Van Den Heuvel, M.R., Dupuis, T., Carr, J. 2011.

The western Atlantic coast from the Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland to Nain in the Labrador is a species transition zone for anadromous salmonids, particularly Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus, but also brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). A parallel transition zone exists in Ungava Bay. The populations in these two areas represent some of the last remaining anadromous populations of salmonid fishes that exist in a relatively pristine state in eastern North America. Moreover, they are central to important subsistence (food) and recreational fisheries, and in some cases commercial fisheries, as well as in social and ceremonial fisheries for aboriginal peoples (e.g. along the Labrador coast, the Metis, Innu and Inuit). In 1997-98, the commercial fishery for Atlantic salmon in Labrador was closed due to declines in population sizes. However, recovery has been slow and now anadromous salmonids face new challenges associated with climate change, as well as development (i.e. highways and industry). Climate change has been predicted to significantly impact northern salmonids, influencing seasonal phenologies and life-history tactics (Reist et al. 2006, Todd et al. 2011). For instance, recent Scandinavian modelling studies have predicted climate-driven increases in primary production of lakes that may reduce the prevalence of anadromy in Arctic charr populations (Finstad and Hein 2012). There are also indications of Atlantic salmon spreading northward (DFO and MNRF 2008, Todd et al. 2011). The research proposed in this first component of the project aims to quantify the spatial and temporal patterns of estuarine and nearshore marine habitat use of co-existing salmonid populations as affected by niche segregation and life history in a changing climate. It integrates across Atlantic and Arctic arenas and links biotelemetry studies of animal movement to ecology, physiology and genomics drawing on expertise from within the team, as well as with the broader Ocean Tracking Network (e.g. Pacific arena salmonid research and the physical-biogeochemical ocean modelling) and beyond (i.e. collaborators in Scandinavia).','Fleming, I., Power, M., Robertson, M., Morris, C., Dempson, B. 2013.

While the behavioral ecology of tiger sharks has been well-studied in the Pacific and Indian Ocean, little is known about the movement patters of tiger sharks in the Atlantic Ocean. By satellite tracking tiger sharks tagged of Florida and the Bahamas, Hammerschlag et al. (2012) found that female tiger shark displayed a pelagic phase lasting several months, with movements following the Gulf Stream, warm currents that support productivity at all trophic levels. Sharks also exhibited an inshore, high residency phase at a popular dive tourism site in the Bahamas, nicknamed Tiger Beach (TB), located on the Northwest edge of little Bahama Bank. Tiger sharks at TB are provisioned by divers year-round by boats to lure tiger sharks within close proximity of dive tourists. While the long-term, large-scale movements of tiger sharks are not impacted by dive tourism at TB, it remains unknown if and how high residency, daily movements, of female sharks at TB are impacted by the provisioning tourism. This would be of particular conservation significance if female sharks were aggregating at TB for reproductive purposes, such as mating or gestating, as hypothesized Hammerschlag et al. (2012). To fill this gap in knowledge, the overall goal of this project is to evaluate the relationship among reproductive state, diet, body condition and residency patterns of female tiger sharks at TB to determine the following:  What are the overall site fidelity and residency patterns of sharks within TB? * Are there any diurnal differences in residency and movement in and out of TB? * Are there any seasonal differences in residency within TB? * Do sharks exhibit higher residency patterns at dive sites or disproportionately use dive sites compared to adjacent areas? * Do shark residency patterns at dive sites differ in the presence or absence of diving or baiting activities? * Do individuals differ in their spatial and temporal use of TB? * What is the pattern and frequency of tiger shark movements between TB and the US eastern seaboard?

Overall chondrichthyan extinction risk is substantially higher than for most other vertebrates, due to their typical Ã«K strategistÃ­ life history characteristics; slow growth, late age of sexual maturity, low fecundity, long life spans and well-developed offspring making them vulnerable to over exploitation and average global exploitation rates often exceed the rebound rates for many species. In many ecosystems elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) fulfil the role of top level predators, the loss of predators often risks wider ecosystem degradation and can act as a herald for marked changes within ecosystems. Therefore, improved management of elasmobranch populations is needed urgently to ensure the future stability and recovery of marine ecosystems with functional top predators. Despite the wide-ranging behaviour of some elasmobranchs, it has been shown that many species make use of the same areas repeatedly either in the form of site fidelity or residency. The incorporation of such behaviours into the management plans for mobile species may allow for strategies such as Marine Protected Areas to be used. There is evidence that spurdog (Squalus acanthias) displays seasonal residency within a Scottish loch, Loch Etive, a sea loch on the west coast of Scotland, however, the extent to which this occurs between age and sex classes occurs.

After a panmictic spawning event in the Sargasso Sea, leptocephalus larvae develop as they drift with ocean currents, eventually reaching coastal water and swimming up rivers ranging from southern Mexico to southern Greenland. There, eels spend the juvenile and adult years, before returning to the Sargasso Sea to spawn. American Eel have exhibited drastic declines in recruitment and are listed as endangered on the IUCN red list, as well as provincially in Ontario. Habitat loss and degradation due to anthropogenic barriers such as hydroelectric dams are considered a significant contributor to the decline of the species. Hydroelectric dams are a dual barrier for eels. During migration into freshwater, dams indirectly impede recruitment by preventing access to upstream habitat; during silver eel migration downstream, injury or mortality by dam features (e.g. turbines) is a direct threat to the survival of the spawning biomass. In collaboration with Energy Ottawa and Carleton University, the Canadian Wildlife Federation (CWF) is conducting a field study of the downstream migration of American Eel past a multi-channel hydroelectric dam that includes one of the first facilities in Canada to be designed for safe downstream migration of American Eel.

Sharks in general, hammerhead sharks in particular, have been under heavy fishing pressure during the last 6 decades, an overfishing process fueled by the high price of shark fins in Asian markets for the elaboration of soup.  Sea turtles are put at high extinction risk by industrial fisheries, a collateral damage, or incidental bycatch of fisheries that target valuable pelagic species.  In principle, a high priority when designing conservation strategies for these highly migratory species should be to avoid interactions with fisheries in the first place.  A network of Marine Protected Areas has been established along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica that roughly covers 1% of the nationÃ­s Exclusive Economic Zone, a network which includes different degrees of protection, from National Wildlife Refuge (some allowance of economic activities) to no-take zones (National Parks and Biological Reserves).  Since 2005 an acoustic monitoring program of hammerhead sharks started in Cocos Island National Park that currently includes 7 listening stations deployed around the island.  The program eventually spread to include other species of sharks and sea turtles, as well as to the Costa Rican mainland, along the southern Nicoya Peninsula.  A partnership with colleagues in Galapagos, Ecuador, and Malpelo, Colombia, who are studying the same species with the same VEMCO acoustic technology, has allowed for the publication of 5 peer reviewed papers on the movements of hammerhead sharks and implications of conservation and management.  Current research is focused on studying the importance of seamounts in waters surrounding Cocos Island National Park for the migratory movements of sea turtles and sharks, and defining the migratory paths through which these animals migrate, to provide decision makers with high quality science for the establishment of conservation and management policy.','Chaves, E., Hearn, A., Arauz, R. 2018.

The Nettilling Lake fishery has been dormant since at least 2001 due to the high cost of air transportation of harvested char back to Iqaluit by Twin Otter airplanes (Janelle Kennedy, personal communication). Nettilling Lake is connected to the ocean (Foxe Basin) to the west by the Koukdjuak River, and to the large Amadjuak Lake to the south via the Amadjuak River. Amadjuak Lake has its own Char quota of 9,100 kg, but this quota has never been active because the Char population is considered to be landlocked and thus, vulnerable to exploitation. It is also thought to be of lesser value due to high parasite loads (Popko 1980, Kristofferson et al. 1991). In August of 2013 and 2014, previously unknown Arctic Char migrations were documented in the Amadjuak River and the north end of Amadjuak lake that included all three known morphs (landlock green, anadromous orange and anadromous silver) (William Hyndman, unpublished data). This strongly suggests that anadromous char may be present in Amadjuak Lake opening the possibility of a fishery that is closer to Iqaluit and consequently more economically viable. In addition to the obvious fishery opportunities that Lake Nettilling/Amadjuak offers, there are many unanswered questions over the general biology and ecology of Arctic Char in this unique freshwater system, particularly relating to the different morphotypes. Given the two colours of anadromous morphotypes, questions remain about the relative importance of lake resources and whether the potentially large food base of this lake explains the abundance of the different morphs. Given this, we hypothesize that the anadromous ï¿½silverï¿½ morphotypes (anadromous char were identified by smaller heads and bigger bodies), that are more similar in colouration to the landlock morphotypes, have a greater reliance on lake production than orange morphotypes? There also exists a wide range of possible movement and migration strategies of Arctic Char in the Nettilling/Amadjuak system given the complexity of the ecosystem that includes a number of rivers, two large lakes, and potentially numerous smaller lakes. Given the colour types in the two anadromous morphs, could orange individuals spend more time at sea? Do the three morphotypes have variable movement behaviors in the system and/or do they choose unique spawning locations? Given the lack of basic information on these Arctic Char populations, a first step to ensure sustainable harvesting if fisheries developed is to understand their large-scale movements patterns. This would include the times fish leave and return from the ocean and the times of movement within winter residency locations between the two large lakes and numerous lakes of the Amadjuak River.','Larocque, S., Young, A., Kennedy, J., Hyndman, W., Tallman, R., Weinz, A., Fisk, A. 2014.','Aaron Fisk','U Windsor','afisk@uwindsor.ca','http://members.oceantrack.org/data/discovery/ANL.htm','DETECTIONS; ACOUSTIC TRANSMITTERS; ACOUSTIC TRANSCEIVERS; ; EARTH SCIENCE > BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION > ANIMALS/VERTEBRATES > FISH','GCMD','By accessing or using OTN Data you agree to: a) give proper attribution to all Data Providers and to OTN by using the preformed citations contained in OTN metadata reports and in the data records, b) inform OTN of publications, products or commercial applications using the data, c) acknowledge that neither the OTN nor the provider is liable for inaccuracies in the data, d) assume responsibility for investigating and understanding the limitations of the data, e) report all problems with respect to data to otndc@dal.ca.

Migration range, duration, movements, habitat use and feeding behaviour in relation to environmental conditions will be investigated.  Very little is known about the movements and feeding of sea-trout.  There are only 3 recent studies on Quebec populations from the Gulf of St. Lawrence (Lenormand et al., 2004; Curry et al., 2006; Morinville and Rasmussen, 2006).  Considering Brook trout are the most popular sports fishery in Nova Scotia (MacMillan and Madden, 2007), regional knowledge of feeding habitats and access routes, combined with environmental interactions, is needed to enhance conservation efforts (Morinville and Rasmussen, 2006; Brenkman et al., 2007). In recent years, fishing pressure on sea-run trout has increased.  A Special Trout Management Area (STMA) was implemented in 2001 in the West River (AH) and immediate estuary to improve the size (FL>35 cm, >3 yrs old) and number of trout caught.  Exploitation outside the STMA is unknown, but comparative creel surveys before and after 2001has shown an increase in overall sizes, and ages to 4 and 5 yr old fish (MacMillan and Madden, 2007).

Currently, there are no standard requirements for biological components of environmental monitoring as part of MHK project licenses. Yet all prospective developers must obtain a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) pilot project license that includes plans for monitoring components of the biological and physical environment. Current active and recently approved MHK biological monitoring plans are site-specific, focus on commercially important local species, and may include listed or endangered species. There is a need to evaluate techniques used to detect change in relevant biological variables and to establish standardized monitoring procedures and thresholds.  Standardization of variables and sampling enables regulators to track environmental monitoring and operational compliance within and across MHK sites. To advance novel, cost-effective environmental monitoring techniques three efforts are needed: (1) Survey protected, demersal, and pelagic fish species using capture and remote sensing techniques; (2) Evaluate techniques (survey instruments, metrics, and statistics) used to monitor and evaluate potential changes to protected, demersal, and pelagic fish species; (3) Compare variability in spatial and temporal distributions of pelagic organisms at wave and tidal MHK sites using a variety of metrics to determine standard metrics which can be used across sites and project types. This project uses active acoustic, passive acoustic, and trawl surveys to evaluate habitat utilization (over space and time) of fish and other pelagic nekton at future wave energy test sites. This information will be used to determine potential interactions between species and installed device components, which will be used for informing permitting. Findings will be compared to surveys at tidal energy test sites. The performance of capture and remote sensing monitoring techniques will be evaluated and generic nekton monitoring indices will be developed for MHK technologies and sites. The findings will contribute to recommendations for sampling procedures for monitoring fish species at MHK sites.  These recommendations will help standardize monitoring requirements for developers, enable comparison of monitoring programs and potential impacts among MHK sites, and can be used to determine thresholds of impacts for operating permits and potential mitigation measures.','Calvanese, T., Henkel, S. 2015.

We conducted a small acoustic telemetry pilot study on 100 Chilko River Chinook that were reared at Chehalis Hatchery B.C. and then transported and released into the Chilko River.  The project goals were to estimate freshwater survival, investigate residence timing in the Strait of Georgia, and begin to investigate early marine survival. Because marine acoustic receiver arrays capable of detecting smolts implanted with small 180 kHz acoustic tags only monitor the northern exit from the Strait of Georgia, residence time and early marine survival could only be potentially estimated if smolts migrated north before tag batteries expired five months after ocean entry. Freshwater survival of acoustic-tagged Chinook to the Fraser River mouth (49%) was comparable to other populations or species which migrate the same distance downstream; however, their downstream migration rate 18 km/day) was dramatically slower than that of wild Chilko Lake sockeye, which migrate rapidly to the ocean after exit from Chilko Lake (100-170 km/day). It is unknown whether this behavioural difference is the result of their hatchery origin and transport to Chilko Lake. Only one fish was detected in the Strait of Georgia and none were detected exiting. Combined with the results from trawl surveys, the complete lack of detections in the Discovery Islands and Johnstone Strait suggest that Chilko Chinook do not migrate directly north after river exit. Instead, they likely remain in the Strait of Georgia for at least several months. It is unclear if smolts eventually exited the Strait via the southern route, died during their summer residence, or simply ceased migration to take up residence.

Previous studies have tracked Salish Sea populations of Chinook during the winter and fall months and found that juvenile Chinook likely either remain resident in the Salish Sea beyond the time when they were tracked, or suffer very high mortality. In late summer 2017, we tested these hypotheses by acoustic-tagging 80 age-0 wild and hatchery Chinook salmon (>140 mm FL) resident near the outlet of the Cowichan River in Maple Bay and Sansum Narrows. The fish were captured using microtrolling and then released near their capture locations after tagging. Mobile tracking was conducted for 10 days in September after tagging was completed, and sporadically throughout the fall. We will track their migration until spring 2018 with an array of special-purpose, short-term, receivers deployed to the north and south of the capture and release areas and at two harbour seal haul-outs. The existing POST sub-arrays in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Northern Strait of Georgia, and Discovery Islands will allow us to determine if fish remain the Salish Sea over winter.

These moorings also monitor current speed and turbulence, marine life activity, ambient noise, and water quality. Observations made by the FAST program will be used to study how the developing tidal power program is impacting its surroundings. The FORCE tidal acoustic receivers will support tracking work ongoing with Atlantic sturgeon, striped bass, Atlantic salmon and American lobster, among other species.

Although several potential causes have been proposed, there has been little conclusive evidence for which factors are responsible or not responsible for these declines. We experimen- tally addressed the hypothesis that exposure of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch or sockeye salmon O. nerka to solar ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) during freshwater rearing of fry and parr life-history stages increases mortality at the time of smoltification and ocean entry. Juvenile coho and sockeye salmon were reared in outdoor hatchery tanks either exposed to full spectrum sun- light or shielded from UVB radiation by plastic screens for up to 9 mo prior to release. Smolts were tagged with acoustic transmitters and detected with hydrophone receivers during their downriver and early ocean migration. Survival of treatment groups was compared using Cormack-Jolly- Seber and Burnham mark-recapture models. While exposure to UVB resulted in decreased growth of juvenile coho salmon, survivorship during the early marine period was unaffected by the UVB treatment for both populations. This first attempt to experimentally address the hypo - thesis of impaired survival resulting from solar UVB radiation has shown that other factors are more likely responsible for observed declines in salmon marine survival rates.

Walton Rocks is home to a resident population of green sea turtles and Inwater Research Group has many recaptures for green turtles via flipper and PIT tags, presumably from turtles inhabiting this Walton Rocks habitats. The receivers would allow us to determine how frequently the turtles are near the intake structures, and how frequently they actually become entrained into the canal itself. We also want to examine movement of green turtles between two bodies of water on either side of Hutchinson Island--the Indian River Lagoon and the Atlantic Ocean. We hypothesize that turtles utilize the waters of the lagoon during summer months but when the water temperatures drop in the winter, the turtles may move to the warmer ocean warmers and utilize the habitat by Walton Rocks. Therefore, by placing the loaned OTN receivers on the ocean side, there would be receivers on both sides of the barrier island. Our plan is to then capture and acoustically tag turtles from the power plant (ocean side) and at a lagoon site and examine the movements of turtles between the two bodies of water.','Guertin, J., Mott, C. 2017.

Exact causes of the decline remain unclear\\; however, riverine barriers to seaward migrating adult eels (silver eels hereafter) are considered a key factor. Specifically, intake screens, pumps and turbines at pumping stations for domestic supply, agriculture and industry, flood control and hydropower generation, can result in the delay or cessation of migration, physical damage and direct mortality of silver eels due to their elongated morphology and poor burst swimming capabilities. For those that do survive, little is known about the impact on the marine phase of silver eel migration. In fact, little is known about the marine phase of silver eel migration generally. To reverse the decline in European eel populations, the European Union has adopted the Eel Recovery Plan (Council Regulation No 1100/2007/EC). This requires all Member States to produce Eel Management Plans (EMPs) detailing actions to meet the target to permit with high probability the escapement to sea of at least 40% of the silver eel biomass relative to the best estimate of escapement that would have existed if no anthropogenic influences had impacted the stock. Mitigation for the effects of riverine barriers and improvements to downstream passage has been highlighted as a key means of achieving escapement targets across Europe (e.g. U.K., Denmark, Greece EMPs). Furthermore, under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) (2000/60/EC) member states are obliged to ensure fish passage at all artificial structures. To meet legislative escapement targets it is important to identify key locations of silver eel loss during freshwater migration. This has led to an ongoing investigation into silver eel migration and entrainment in three rivers that enter The Wash, England. The downstream limit of the study is current the tidal limit. With the support of the OTN a line of receivers will be deployed across the mouth of The Wash to investigate the initial marine phase of the eel migration. To this end, the study will be divided into the following specific objectives: i) Determine the catchment-wide downstream migration of silver eels in relation to environmental conditions (river flow, water temperatures, lunar phase and time of day) and pumping station operation using acoustic tags and receivers. ii) Determine the initial marine phase migration of silver eel captured in freshwater, tagged and released downstream of the pumping station. iii) Assess the impact of passage through pumping stations on the initial marine phase of the eel migration. The information gained will provide valuable guidance for optimising escapement of adult eels, in line with EU requirements, at the respective study sites. In addition, the Environment Agency and national conservation organisations will be able to use these outputs to inform, underpin and revise policy and conservation practices to deliver appropriate protection for the species nationally.','Bolland, D. 2015.

The goal of this research is to characterize the movement patterns, habitat use, and regional connectivity of permit and Atlantic tarpon. To accomplish this, Bonefish and Tarpon Trust, in Collaboration with Carleton University, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, are conducting a long term (2015-2022) acoustic telemetry project. We maintain an array 75 acoustic receivers in nearshore habitats of the Florida Keys, and collaborate with the Florida Acoustic Telemetry Network (FACT), and Integrated Tracking of Animals in the Gulf (iTAG) to track these species throughout the coastal regions of the United States. To date, >40 permit and >60 Atlantic tarpon have been tagged with acoustic transmitters, which have shown diverse movement patterns. Permit exhibit extremely high site fidelity to certain shallow water flats, but make large scale movements to the Florida Reef Tract to spawn, which our data suggests occurs in months of the year outside of the current harvest protection period. Atlantic tarpon of a large size range (20-60 kg) make even larger scale movements, over 1000 km, throughout the eastern coast of the United States, suggesting a major need for multi-state cooperative management strategies. Moving forward, this project will continue to characterize the diverse movement patterns of these fish species, and provide significant detection coverage in the nearshore regions of the Florida Keys for diverse marine species tagged by our collaborators in FACT and iTAG.','Brownscombe, J.W., Griffin, L.P., Danylchuk, A.J., Cooke, S.J., Adams, A.J.

Fishes tagged with acoustic transmitting tags will broadcast unique signals that will be archived by an array of acoustic hydrophone receivers in the Minas Passage. A dense array of receivers located at the OpenHydro turbine site will provide fine scale information on movements and behaviour of fish in relation to an operating tidal turbine. In addition a line of receivers spanning the Passage, placed in co-operation with OTN and Acadia University, will provide information on the spatial and temporal distribution and movement of fish in the Passage. To enhance the assessment of the risk to fishes of direct contact with the turbine, in situ data will be used to refine mathematical hydrodynamic models that predict how objects like fish move in the Passage and potentially interact with turbine infrastructure. This information will be valuable in identifying mitigation measures that may be taken to lessen any negative effects of in-stream turbine infrastructure on fish behaviour and survival.','Broome, J., Stokesbury, M., Redden, A., Bradford, R. 2009. 3-D Acoustic  Tracking of Fish, Sediment-Laden Ice and Large Wood Debris in the  Minas Passage of the Bay of Fundy.','Anna Redden','Acadia U','anna.redden@acadiau.ca','http://www.bofep.org/minas.htm','ACOUSTIC RECEIVERS; DETECTIONS; ACOUSTIC TRANSMITTERS; ; EARTH SCIENCE > BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION > ANIMALS/VERTEBRATES > FISH','GCMD','By accessing or using OTN Data you agree to: a) give proper attribution to all Data Providers and to OTN by using the preformed citations contained in OTN metadata reports and in the data records, b) inform OTN of publications, products or commercial applications using the data, c) acknowledge that neither the OTN nor the provider is liable for inaccuracies in the data, d) assume responsibility for investigating and understanding the limitations of the data, e) report all problems with respect to data to otndc@dal.ca.

The OTN infrastructure and technology will be exploited to  establish the migration routes of both yellow and silver life-history stages from Lake Ontario to the St. Lawrence line and beyond to the Cabot Strait and Halifax lines as well as to identify the abiotic and  biotic conditions that prevail along the migratory pathway. Two stages of the species lifecycle will be investigated in the context of this project: yellow-stage eels (juveniles) and silver-stage eels  (reproductive stage). For both of these, a system-wide effort to capture and acoustically tag individuals will be conducted in the spring/summer of 2010 and 2011. Specific sampling areas will include  Cornwall, Montreal the Trois-RiviÃ¨res region, Ile d\'OrlÃ©ans and along the south of the middle estuary where a traditional eel fishery occurs. Surgically implanted model V9 and V13 model tags, depending on  fish size, will be used (300 pingers in total). Several acoustic barriers will be installed along the St. Lawrence River and Estuary. Alongside these telemetry efforts, the different habitat-use patterns of  yellow eels will also be studied through the analysis of otolith microchemistry. The otolith analyses will be used to calculate age, growth and to establish chronologies of habitats used by the eel during  its growth. Migration routes of the silver eel stages towards the presumed spawning site (Sargasso Sea) will also be determined by V13 pingers. Furthermore, transmitter tags fitted with a new generation of  miniature satellite pop up tags (15 individuals to be equipped in year 2) will enable us to track, for the first time, diel horizontal and vertical migrations. Field sampling and tagging efforts will be conducted during the initial spring downstream migration and throughout the feeding season in the estuary (July to September) during the first two years of the  project: 2010 and 2011. 2010 will constitute a test year, with a reduced number of tagged eels and receivers deployed. 2011 will mark the first year where all equipment is to be fully deployed. This will  insure a continuous monitoring of estuarine residents during the summer and fall in order to counteract the short tag life.','Dodson, J., Castonguay, M., BÃ©guer.

Beginning in the early 1950s, several salmonid species were introduced to Kerguelen, which was devoid of any native fish fauna. Since then, brown trout have successfully invaded the landscape and established several self-sustaining breeding populations. Kerguelen thus provides a rare opportunity to study the process of colonization (e.g. demography, habitat use, movement patterns and range expansion) in the absence of confounding factors such as inter-specific competition with native fish species and human activities. Despite recent research efforts into the invasion dynamics of brown trout, many questions remain unanswered and limit our basic biological understanding of salmonids exploration and colonization behaviour. How far do anadromous brown trout from the colonization front migrate in the marine environment? Do they explore other freshwater systems along the way? What role do phenotype and environmental conditions have in mediating exploration behaviour? Using a combination of acoustic telemetry and bio-sampling techniques, we will test the over-arching hypothesis that inter-individual differences in marine habitat use and exploration behaviour by brown trout are explained by intrinsic (phenotypic differences) and by extrinsic (environmental) factors. Specifically, we will: i) quantify the marine and freshwater habitat use of individual brown trout along the colonization front at Kerguelen; ii) examine how well phenotypic traits explain individual movement and exploration behaviour; and iii) examine whether seasonal, environmental variation in temperature and salinity also influence exploration behaviour. In Jan 2018, we deployed a total of 52 acoustic receivers in rivers, estuaries, and in the marine environment surrounding the brown trout colonization front of Kerguelen Archipelago - currently located in Baie Irlandaise. Subsequently, in Jan and Feb 2018, we externally tagged 50 adult brown trout with acoustic transmitters that record ambient temperature and conductivity, as well as collected measurements, scales and blood samples to characterize individual phenotypes. After tagging and sampling, fish were released back in the environment and subsequently detected in the acoustic array. Receivers will be recovered and downloaded in Jan 2019. The salmonid invasion of Kerguelen\'s fish-less, glacially-fed, and under-exploited ecological niches makes an excellent study context to develop modelling tools applicable to predicting the movement of salmonids to the new, fish-less habitats in other Arctic and Antarctic regions exposed via melting glaciers. Ultimately, this study will provide key information about the intrinsic and extrinsic factors underlying invasion, range expansion, and colonization.',' Gaudin, P., Davidsen, J.G., Crossin, G.T., Bordeleau, X., Whoriskey, F.G. 2018.

Initial telemetry  studies were of native populations in the Narraguagus River and have since expanded to other rivers and varying age classes of both hatchery and naturally-reared smolts. NOAA\'s present focus is on the  Penobscot River. Although the Penobscot River boasts the largest number of adult ATS returns in the northeast United States (~2,000 annually), smolt to adult return rates remain below 1% (USASAC 2010).  Smolt telemetry research on the Penobscot River has been taking place since 2005; we have used a variety of smolt origins in our assessments which are representative of naturally-reared and hatchery products  used in restoration activities in the system. We are focused on better understanding smolt migration dynamics, quantifying migration success and identifying areas of high mortality through estuarine and bay  areas within the study array and beyond into coastal waters in collaborations with OTN and other partners. We use this information in support of management activities to reduce threats, evaluate project  impacts and work windows, and to improve ATS survival in the near shore marine environment. NOAA\'s Penobscot Marine Array uses acoustic telemetry in Penobscot estuary and bay to passively monitor smolt movements through a static array of over 130 receivers, which are maintained in cooperation the University of Maine.
